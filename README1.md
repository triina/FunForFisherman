# FunForFisherman

It is a web app for fishing enthusiasts.
You can record you catches (weight, length, type), lures and lure types, locations (via compass or GPS), as well as anything you want.
You need to set up a user account, however, the information you share is only for you.
Since fishermen don't like to share their secret locations!
